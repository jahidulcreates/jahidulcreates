# About Me

I am a machine learning and NLP researcher with a strong focus on deep learning, sentiment analysis, neural sequence models, and low-resource language processing. My work includes two IEEE-published research papers that explore hybrid neural architectures (such as CNN–BiLSTM) and transformer-based models like BERT for Bengali text classification.

I come from a dual background of **research and scalable software engineering**. As a Solution Architect and Senior Engineer, I design backend systems, distributed applications, and cloud-native infrastructures. My engineering experience complements my research direction, enabling me to bridge algorithmic ideas with production-ready implementations.

My long-term goal is to pursue advanced research (MS/PhD) in machine learning, NLP, and AI-driven systems, with a focus on neural models for understudied languages, efficient transformers, and deployable AI architectures.
